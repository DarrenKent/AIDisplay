AI Display for Dixie State University.

At Dixie State University they have an Artificial Intelligence class that teaches how to create an agent that searches for objects in a virtual world. The agent must decide what objects they desire and deposit them back at base. The original display was a two demensional grid that did not provide a lot of information. So I worked with the instructor for my capstone project to create a new display for this assignment so that students could see more of what was going on. I had to work with an already existing system and conform my display to work with this system. The project took a little over 200 hours to complete. Since the source code of this project is sensitive, I have recieved permission to post the code that I worked on directly. The server and client source code is not available.
