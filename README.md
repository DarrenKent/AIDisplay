About the Project
-------------
At Dixie State University they have an Artificial Intelligence class that teaches how to create an agent that searches for objects in a virtual world. The agent must decide what objects they desire and deposit them back at base. The original display was a two demensional grid that did not provide a lot of information. So I worked with the instructor for my capstone project to create a new display for this assignment so that students could see more of what was going on. I had to work with an already existing system and conform my display to work with this system. The project took a little over 200 hours to complete. Since the source code of this project is sensitive, I have recieved permission to post the code that I worked on directly. The server and client source code is not available.

About the Creator
-------------
My name is Darren Kent and I am graduate from Dixie State University with a Bachelors in Computer
Science. Throughout my life games have been my passion. From board games to card games and
ever since I got my first NES when I was a kid, video games. Over time I have developed many
skills that will help me in the future with making games. For a long time I worked as a graphic
artist and I decided to pursue a Bachelors degree in Computer Science. I figured
with the skills I have, why not try my hand at making games and I have been loving it ever since.
